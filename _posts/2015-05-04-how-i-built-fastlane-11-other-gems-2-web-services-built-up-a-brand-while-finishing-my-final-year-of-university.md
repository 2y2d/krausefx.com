## Managing my time

 
   
>[@krausefx](https://twitter.com/KrauseFx) I would ask again if you ever sleepâ€¦ but at this stage I think the answer is pretty clear ðŸ˜„â€” Radek Pietruszewski (@radexp)

I get asked about how I manage my time to work on so many open source projects. I started last September to work on the first fastlane tool 
[deliver](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver). One tool led to another, resulting in a whole toolchain with the umbrella application 
[fastlane](https://fastlane.tools).

For meÂ programming is not about the joy of programming but to get a job done. When I learn something newÂ I always have my goals in mind.

I haven't written a single line of Objective C the last 6 months. And no, I haven't triedÂ anything in Swift yet. I'm working in Ruby 100% of my time. My current goal is to make fastlane the best Continuous Delivery solution for mobile projects out there.

With that in mind, I tend to solve problems as pragmatic as possible.Â
