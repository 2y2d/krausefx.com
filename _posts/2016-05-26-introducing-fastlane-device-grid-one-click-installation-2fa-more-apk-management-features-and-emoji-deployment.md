In May, we focused on making pull requests more powerful and introduced enhanced deployment options. For more details, check out the full blog post on [fabric.io/blog](https://fabric.io/blog/fastlane-updates-powerful-prs-enhanced-deployment).
 
### fastlane device grid

Tired of locally compiling your app just to test and preview a change? From now on, you can test your app straight on GitHub from the pull request using 
[device grid](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/fastlane/lib/fastlane/actions/device_grid#readme).

### One-click installation via the Fabric Mac app


Want to install fastlane with one quick click? You can do it directly from the Fabric Mac app. 

### Two-step verification


Looking to take advantage of two-step verification for stronger security? All fastlane tools now support two factor authentication. 

### APK expansion file upload and APK promote to track capability

Last but not least, thanks to awesome contributions from the community, it’s easier than ever to upload APK expansion files and promote existing beta builds to production on Google Play.
