Sigh... you have code signing issues again? Introducing 
sigh, which creates all necessary certificates for App Store, Ad Hoc and Development for you.

What it does:

* **Download** the latest provisioning profile for your app
* **Renew** a provisioning profile, when it has expired
* **Repair** a provisioning profile, when it is broken
* **Create** a new provisioning profile, if it doesn't exist already
* Supports **App Store**, **Ad Hoc** and **Development** profiles
