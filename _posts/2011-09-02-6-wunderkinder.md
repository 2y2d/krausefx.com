Hi everyone!

Hopefully you are already aware of my 
[Bikemap App](http://bikemap.felixkrause.at/). It was downloaded over 50.000 times within 4 months, a huge success for me and I couldn’t have done it without you!

Some quick facts:

* I scored second place with this app in the 
[U19 freestyle computing](http://new.aec.at/prix/de/gewinner/2011/#u19) competition and was chosen from over 650 participants
* I was in the 
[Futurezone.at](http://futurezone.at/produkte/2453-bikemap-die-radrouten-app.php), one of the most famous IT-blogs from Austria
* The Austrian Kurier wrote about this app in the printed version
* Bikemap was the most downloaded sports app in Austria, Czechia and Qatar
* Sebastian Kreutzberger, the CTO of 
[6Wunderkinder](http://6wunderkinder.com/), noticed this app and offered me an iOS developer position. [Wunderlist](http://wunderlist.com/) and Bikemap were both developed in Titanium and one day I decided to tweet to Appcelerator announcing my recent number of downloads. Sebastian noticed my tweet and quickly got into contact with, we chatted and then he offered me a job. 6Wunderkinder is a totally cool company, and you can see this by the people who work 
[here](http://www.6wunderkinder.com/about/).

Before I started working, I participated at a Appcelerator Titanium Training to become a 
Certified Titanium Application Developer. It was a huge milestone in my young career and I hope to gain more training in the future.


6Wunderkinder is a Berlin based startup founded in August of 2010 and creates multi-platform productivity solutions for individuals, groups and businesses. Currently I am working on a productivity platform named 
[Wunderkit](http://wunderkit.com/). Recently, I submitted an update of Wunderlist for iPhone and iPad to the App Store. I also worked on the next 
[Wunderlist](http://wunderlist.com/) version that includes iOS, Mac and Windows. This week I started to work on
[Wunderkit](http://wunderkit.com/) projects and look forward to the upcoming challenges. I have the greatest team that provides good support, feedback and lot’s of laughter.
